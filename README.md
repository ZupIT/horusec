## What is Horusec?
Horusec is an open source tool that performs static code analysis to identify security flaws during the development process. Currently, the languages for analysis are: C#, Java, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, Golang, Terraform, Javascript, Typescript, Kubernetes, PHP, C, HTML, JSON, Dart, Elixir, Shell, Nginx. The tool has options to search for key leaks and security flaws in all files of your project, as well as in Git history. Horusec can be used by the developer through the CLI and by the DevSecOps team on CI /CD mats. See in our [DOCUMENTATION](https://horusec.io/docs/overview/) the complete list of tools and languages that we perform analysis

To see more details how install go to <a href="https://horusec.io/docs/cli/installation/">HERE</a>

#### Check the installation
```bash
horusec version
```

## Usage CLI
To use horusec-cli and check the application's vulnerabilities:
```bash
horusec start -p="./"
```

**WARN:** When horusec starts an analysis it creates a folder called `.horusec`. This folder serves as the basis for not changing your code. So we recommend that you add the line `.horusec` into your `.gitignore` file so that this folder does not need to be sent to your git server!


## Usage with Docker
```sh
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(pwd):/src horuszup/horusec-cli:latest horusec start -p /src -P $(pwd)
```

## Usage with Horusec-Web application
Generate your the authorization token in order to be able to access the report through the web application.
See more about [**Horusec web application here**](https://github.com/ZupIT/horusec-platform)

```bash
horusec start -p="./" -a="<YOUR_TOKEN_AUTHORIZATION>"
```

To acquire the authorization token and be able to analytically check the application's vulnerabilities on our panel, see more details <a href="https://horusec.io/docs/tutorials/how-to-create-an-authorization-token">HERE</a>.
