## What is Horusec?
Horusec is an open source tool that performs static code analysis to identify security flaws during the development process. Currently, the languages for analysis are: C#, Java, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, Golang, Terraform, Javascript, Typescript, Kubernetes, PHP, C, HTML, JSON, Dart. The tool has options to search for key leaks and security flaws in all files of your project, as well as in Git history. Horusec can be used by the developer through the CLI and by the DevSecOps team on CI /CD mats. See in our [DOCUMENTATION](https://horusec.io/docs) the complete list of tools and languages that we perform analysis

## Project roadmap 2021

We started the project to aggregate within our company, but as the search grew more and more we chose to apply good practices and open it up for everyone to collaborate with this incredible project.

In order to achieve our goals, we separated in some delivery phases:

- **Phase 0:** Support for all horusec-cli features into [horusec-vscode](https://github.com/ZupIT/horusec-vscode-plugin) (Q1)
- **Phase 1:** Support for the Theia(VsCode Web) (Q1)
- **Phase 2:** Support to Flutter, Dart, Bash, Shell, Elixir, Cloujure e Scala in analysis (Q1)
- **Phase 3:** New service to manager vulnerabilities founds (Q2)
- **Phase 4:** Dependency analysis for all supported languages (Q3)
- **Phase 5:** SAST with MVP Semantic Analysis (Q4)
- **Phase 6:** DAST with MVP symbolic analysis (Q4)

## Getting started

## Installing
To see more details how install go to <a href="horusec-cli#installing">HERE</a>

#### Check the installation
```bash
horusec version
```

## Usage
For use horusec-cli and check your vulnerabilities
```bash
horusec start
```

or send with the authorization token to view the content analytically in the horusec admin panel.

```bash
horusec start -a="<YOUR_TOKEN_AUTHORIZATION>"
```
To acquire the authorization token and you can see your vulnerabilities analytically on our panel see more details <a href="horusec-cli#authorization">HERE</a>


**WARN:** When horusec starts an analysis it creates a folder called `.horusec`. This folder serves as the basis for not changing your code. So we recommend that you add the line `.horusec` into your `.gitignore` file so that this folder does not need to be sent to your git server!
