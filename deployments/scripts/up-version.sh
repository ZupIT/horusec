# The purpose of this script is to simplify the way of generating a tag for github.
#  Example:
#    * A correction was made and updated the develop branch:
#      * ./deployments/scripts/up-version.sh alpha
#    * A new feature was made and updated the develop branch:
#      * ./deployments/scripts/up-version.sh alpha
#    * We are preparing the branch to develop and send it to production:
#      * ./deployments/scripts/up-version.sh rc
#    * After opening the PR and performing the merge of develop on the master, we must update the master and develop tag:
#      * ./deployments/scripts/up-version.sh minor
#    * We made a correction(hotfix) to the production environment and we have already merged the master branch and automatically need to update the develop branch:
#      * ./deployments/scripts/up-version.sh release
#    * We had to do a refactoring in the services and hear a "breaking changes" in the master branch:
#      * ./deployments/scripts/up-version.sh major
