## **Before you contribute**

### **Code of Conduct**
Please follow the [**Code of Conduct**](https://github.com/ZupIT/horusec/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all your interactions with our project.

### **Legal**
- Horusec is licensed over [**ASF - Apache License**](https://github.com/ZupIT/horusec/blob/main/LICENSE), version 2, so new files must have the ASF version 2 header. For more information, please check out [**Apache license**](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

- All contributions are subject to the [**Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)**](https://developercertificate.org). 
When you commit, use the ```**-s** ``` option to include the Signed-off-by line at the end of the commit log message.

## **Prerequisites**
Check out the requisites before contributing to Horusec:

### **Developer Certificate of Origin - DCO**

 This is a security layer for the project and for the developers. It is mandatory.
 
 Follow one of these two methods to add DCO to your commits:
 
**1. Command line**
 Follow the steps: 
 **Step 1:** Configure your local git environment adding the same name and e-mail configured at your GitHub account. It helps to sign commits manually during reviews and suggestions.

 ```
git config --global user.name ‚ÄúName‚Äù
git config --global user.email ‚Äúemail@domain.com.br‚Äù
```
**Step 2:** Add the Signed-off-by line with the `'-s'` flag in the git commit command:

```
$ git commit -s -m "This is my commit message"
```
**2. GitHub website**

You can also manually sign your commits during GitHub reviews and suggestions, follow the steps below: 

**Step 1:** When the commit changes box opens, manually type or paste your signature in the comment box, see the example:

```
Signed-off-by: Name < e-mail address >
```

For this method, your name and e-mail must be the same registered to your GitHub account.

### **Code Review**
- All your submissions needs a review.

### **Pull Requests**
When you open a PR, follow the requisites below:
- You need to add a title describing the issue. 
- Answer the questions about what you did, how to verify it and a description for the changelog, see an example:

<p align="center" margin="20 0"><img src="assets/horusec-pr.PNG" alt="architecture" width="100%" style="max-width:100%;"/></p>
