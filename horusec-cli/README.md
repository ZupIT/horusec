# HORUSEC-CLI
This is a Command Line Interface to make it easier to use horusec services.
Its objective is to find vulnerabilities and errors in projects.
Working as an information centralizer, horusec becomes an orchestrator of security tools by centralizing its outputs in one place, thus facilitating the analytical part of how many security flaws my projects contain, what those flaws are, who made that flaw and even in some cases the best way to correct it.
To learn more about the structure of this service you can see more in this <a href="../assets/horusec-cli.jpg">/assets/horusec-cli.jpg</a>.
